Version control accomplished using Git and GitHub.
Program can be found under username "dmmv2r" and project is named "OSmcdonoug.6".

NOTE: Project is not complete and does not fully execute. Project is safe to compile and run.
In its current state, the program gets a child processes resource needs and sends and receives messages to and from master and child.
Program also finds a random empty page, a random empty frame, and then inserts the respective info into each. The empty page will contain the frame location and the frame location contains the page location.

NOTE: I again kept getting stuck and took a while to get through each step. I did not have enough time to fully complete this project.
